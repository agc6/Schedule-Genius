1. Add state in LandingPage component to track if the sign-in modal is open.
2. Create SignInModal component with form fields and a close button.
3. In the LandingPage, replace the <a> tag for sign-in with a <button> that toggles the modal's visibility.
4. Implement the SignInModal component to appear based on the state.
5. Style SignInModal with CSS for proper display as a modal.

FROM GPT ///////////////
To add state in the LandingPage component to track if the sign-in modal is open, you can use React's useState hook. This hook allows you to add React state to function components. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

Import useState from React: At the top of your file, make sure to import useState from React alongside any other imports you may have.

Initialize State: Use the useState hook to initialize a new state variable. This variable will keep track of whether the sign-in modal is open or not. You'll also get a setter function to update this value.

Use State in the Component: Utilize the state variable to conditionally render the sign-in modal based on its value.

Example Code
Here's how you can add and initialize the state in your LandingPage component:

////// SAMPLE
import React, { useState } from 'react';
// Make sure to include any other imports you need

const LandingPage = () => {
  // Initialize state with useState hook
  // The initial value is false because the modal is not shown by default
  const [isSignInModalOpen, setIsSignInModalOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your existing component JSX */}
      <button className="btn btn-secondary" onClick={() => setIsSignInModalOpen(true)}>Sign In</button>
      {/* Use isSignInModalOpen to conditionally render or hide your sign-in modal */}
      {isSignInModalOpen && (
        <SignInModal onClose={() => setIsSignInModalOpen(false)} />
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default LandingPage;


Explanation
useState(false) initializes the isSignInModalOpen state variable with a default value of false, indicating that the sign-in modal should not be visible initially.
setIsSignInModalOpen is a function that you can call to change the value of isSignInModalOpen. When you want to show the modal, you set it to true, and when you want to hide the modal, you set it back to false.
The onClick handler for the Sign In button is set to a function that calls setIsSignInModalOpen(true), which will show the modal.
The SignInModal component is conditionally rendered based on the value of isSignInModalOpen. It only appears if isSignInModalOpen is true.
Inside the SignInModal, you should have a way to close the modal, typically a button that calls onClose, which in turn sets isSignInModalOpen to false, hiding the modal.
This is a basic implementation of state management for modal visibility in a React functional component using the useState hook.
